## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to document remaining traces of a VM post-spoof. It's intended use is to be used as a template for security research and defensive analysis. This does not cover all possible remaining traces, it focuses on the common, easily identifiable traces that exist post-spoofing when using the upstream repo's guide. All testing was performed in isolated lab environments and no exploit code or PoCs are included.

## Scope
All testing was done on a Windows 10 22H2 Virtual Machine, following the upstream repository's instructions.
